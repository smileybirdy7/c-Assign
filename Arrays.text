According to the guy in the "Arrays" video,"arrays are a way of storing a collection of data of the same type together." 
He explained how important square brackets are in setting up an array.
In the video he also showed us what arrays are, by setting one up on his computer. 
He also gave us the syntax for an array which is, type[] nameOfArray = new type[number of elements];
Then he showed us how to set up "the index of an element" in an array. 
He first showed us how to index an element in an array individually, and then he showed us how to do it all in a single line.
The example he showed in the video is the following:  int [] myIntArray = {12, 76, 8, 937, 903};
Then he explained how public modifiers can be seen "in the inspector." He also explained how arrays work very well with for loops.
