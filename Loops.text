In the loop video, I first learned about the while loop, what it means, and its syntax. 
Then I learned about the do while loop and its syntax. 
A few significant differences between the while loop and the do while loop, is 
1) the do while loop starts with the word "do" 2) the do while loop uses a semicolon, but the while loop doesn't, and
 3) the content in the do while loop runs once and the content in the while loop runs numerous times.
 The next loop I learned about was the for loop, which has a similar syntax to the while loop. 
 This similarity is the for or while word and then the stuff in the parenthesises, and then the body of the syntax.   
 The contents in this loop also runs a few times as well.
 Lastly, I learned about a new loop called the foreach loop and its syntax that is very similar to an array.
