In the "Classes" video, I learned how we can use this very beneficial tool to help us properly set up our code. 
Instead of having some very messy and sloppy code like in JavaScript, we can have some very precise and beautiful code in C#. 
This is what this video mostly covered about how we can use classes to help us clean up our code.

In the next video called "Scope and Access Modifiers", I learned about two different "access modifiers", which are called public and private. 
This video also explained and showed me the difference between using these two modifiers. 
When we use a public modifier in our class, we can not only access the code inside this class, but also any code from other class that are labeled public. 
However, when we use a private modifier we can't use the code outside of the class this modifier is in. 
The program we are using also can't see any code from a class with a private modifier because it is marked private.
