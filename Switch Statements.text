In the switch statements video, I learned a lot of information I already learned in class, and a lot of new information I never knew about the syntax of switch statements. 
A new thing I didn't know, was that the default key word in the switch statement, is like the else key word in a if statement. 
Another thing I didn't know that the break key word can also be called "the jump statement."
Pretty much, I was familiar with quite a bit of the other stuff the guy in the video talked about.
