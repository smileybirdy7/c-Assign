In the "If Statements" video the guy talked about how we can use these if statements and sometimes if/else statements to tell the program what we want the code to do. 
If statements to me are like the managers of a company, and we are their boss. If statements cannot let a certain thing happen without our approval. 
We make the decisions or orders and they make sure they happen. It will never be the other way around. We tell our managers (if statements) if this happens than this is the consequence. 
Else if that doesn't happen this will happen.
